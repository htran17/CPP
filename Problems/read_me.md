This is a folder that cointains some small interview problems that I faced before.

In file print_3digit.cpp, Proving a int number input, output should be print out with comma every 3 digits from right to left. For Example: input = 1980620 => output = 1,980,620. 
Compile: g++ print_3digit.cpp -o print_3digit.out -std=c++11
